The Palisades fire remains active, especially in Topanga Canyon and Las Flores Canyon, with firefighting crews working diligently to contain it and prevent it from spreading north and east, potentially threatening urban areas such as Beverly Glen and the Hollywood Hills. The Eaton fire has resulted in extensive destruction, with satellite images revealing widespread fire damage in western Altadena. Despite the challenges posed by strong winds and shifting conditions, there is an emphasis on the efforts of firefighters and the importance of staying updated on evacuation zones and fire status through local resources. The community is experiencing anxiety related to fire risks while some areas maintain normalcy despite the proximity to evacuation zones.']\",\n          \"['This topic focuses on the weather conditions associated with Santa Ana winds, particularly in Southern California. It includes forecasts of strong winds with gusts expected to reach between 35 to 75 mph across various regions, including mountains and valleys. The discussions highlight the impact of these winds on fire weather conditions, mentioning red flag warnings due to dry humidity levels and the potential for critical fire weather. Additionally, the forecasts point to a transition from Santa Ana winds to a cold upper low, which may bring a chance of showers and cooler temperatures. The overall theme centers around the dynamic nature of wind conditions and their implications for weather, safety, and fire risks in the area.']\",\n          \"['The topic revolves around the challenges and dynamics of urban water supply systems, particularly focusing on fire hydrants, water pressure, and the impact of high demand during emergencies such as wildfires.

the images were taken at 10 pt during a time of significant cloud cover across the los angeles area because of that they are a mix of shortwave infrared and visible satellite images shortwave infrared sensors on maxars satellites allow them to detect more things on the ground than are in the visible light spectrum which is visible to the naked eye such as heat signatures everything illuminated in orange or white indicates locations where fire has been detected the imagery shows the eaton wildfire has set nearly every building in western altadena on fire from the altadena trailhead to the

contact with them that address is right on the boundary of an evac warning zone things have got ta be hectic in that part of town what with the kenneth fire popping up yesterday and being knocked down the big concern is the palisades fire which is barely contained given the prevailing wind blowing from the north and the amount of firefighting assets that have been deployed to that area air attack units were hitting that fire all day yesterday i would expect that it doesnt manage to burn all the way up into calabasas but its difficult to be certain of that with how quickly conditions shift theres also always the possibility that another small fire pops up nearby the west valley is quite vulnerable to wildfires due to the amount of urbanwilderness interface that there is out there so while i dont think your friend is in danger certainly not imminent danger its not impossible that theyll be forced to evacuate even if they have already done so and returned it might be tough to get in touch with them with all that going on', 'mulholland is a very long road that runs all the way from the 101 freeway in hollywood to leo carrillo state beach west of malibu do you know roughly where

fire hydrant situation to quote two mainstream news articles ap and npr first comment followed by a very good third piece of academic analysis on some of the complex dynamics between urbanwildfires and urban water infrastructure systems second comment article 1 for some 15 hours as out of control in los angeles the public water system faced four times its usual demand causing some hydrants to run dry and hindering the fight against the flames local water officials said wednesday the los angeles department of water and power was pushing water from aqueducts and groundwater into the system but demand was so high it wasnt enough to refill three onemillion gallon tanks in hilly pacific palisades that help pressurize hydrants for the neighborhood they went dry on several occasions and at least 1000 buildings were engulfed in flames that prompted a swirl of criticism on social media against los angeles mayor karen bass and gov gavin newsoms water management policies including from presidentelect donald trump regional water officials pushed back on wednesday saying the system was strained due to heavy stress on a municipal water system not designed for fighting such massive blazes article 2 janisse qui\\u00f1ones ceo of the los angeles department of water and power said the fight to contain the flames has put immense strain on the system she is pleading with residents to conserve water not just in the palisades area but the whole system she said because the fire department needs the water to fight the fire and were fighting a wildfire with an urban water system and that is really challenging qui\\u00f1ones says her department is working to make sure it can get water to first responders in part by sending them water tanks and pulling water from other parts of the system we pushed the system to the extreme she said during a wednesday news conference four times the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight she is pleading with residents to conserve water not just in the palisades area but the whole system she said because the fire department needs the water to fight the fire and were fighting a wildfire with an urban water system and that is really challenging note continued in next comment below', 'i dont have any more info than you do but i work in utilities fire hydrants are essentially just special caps on pipes that connect to the city water system typically just your domestic water system the same water feeding your house when you open up the hydrant water comes gushing out due to the pressure in the system if hydrants arent supplying water it means that that water system has largely lost pressure there are a lot of different water providers around la sometimes multiple in the same city i believe the city i work in has 3 with one being operated by the city itself and two being operated by third party utility companies these systems can be connected but also may draw water from other sources i can tell you right now my faucets are still running so there is water out here still but its possible that certain water systems near the fire have lost pressure this may be because of over use when designing these models are run assuming that multiple hydrants are running at the same time but obviously at a certain point the system can get overwhelmed due to too much water coming out basically in this case it means that the pipes arent big enough to channel enough water fast enough and your pressure drops another way pressure may have dropped is if there is some kind of problem in that systems water source so its possible that a local water provider gets its water from a water tower up in the hills you keep it up high so that water connections at lower elevations can keep pressure basically the water up on the hill is pushing down on the entire system if those towers were damaged then that system would start to fail similar some systems rely on pumps to get water pressure if those pumps get knocked out of commission they typically have backup power sources but those only last so long plus if the fire hits the pump station who knows what would happen then your system is going to have problems my city actually uses a combination of these we pump water from a lower elevation up to the hills where its stored in giant reservoirs those then drain into the system at large while we monitor the levels and run the pumps as necessary to make sure the water level in the reservoirs dont drop tldr hydrants cant run out of water but the system can lose pressure such that hydrants stop functioning this may be happening in some locations but that doesnt mean that we are looking at a city wide failure more likely is just a single water purveyors system is failing this would still be very bad but i dont think it would be enough to stop our fire department here', 'in my city everything is manually valved except the large 48 stuff that feeds the water storage we want bigger tanks to be built for holding more water but the state will not allow us to even our largest towers couldnt keep up with this kind of flow demand when you hook up a pump truck and start pulling water depending on water main size and material you can completely collapse the main im not saying this is the case but just recently happened here a few months ago we had 2 houses go up on a dead end road in an older part of town the mains have not been replaced yet and are not sized for modern codes the fire hydrants are marked as such and have been flagged in the system as low flow so that anyone who needs them knows they cant pull enough water even with all of this the fire dept still rolled up and saw that theres 2 fully engulfed houses and proceeds to hook up to the hydrant directly in front of house 1 and throttles up the truck trying to pull full water they out ran the main and lost water pressure so they run 400ft of hose up the hill to the next hydrant and now tried to pull full water from both hydrants and you guessed it again they lost water pressure my point here is the fire dept should know why their losing water here but instead ran more hose and hooked to a 3rd hydrant upstream of the last 2 expecting a different result yet ran out of water again luckily they didnt collapse the main another issue when you over draw water like this you can pull water from peoples homes pools all sorts of things and contaminate the water mains i cant even begin to imagine how they are going to deal with the infrastructure rebuilding in this area its probably 5050 at this point for cost to just run all new water lines vs recharging mains checking all the pressures and getting an effective udf program to restore this area']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
